Welcome to my Python 3 tutorial! This is a series of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), along with generated slides and notes sheets to help someone just learning Python learn the ropes. I used my experience as a CS tutor and my personal Python experience to generate these, so I hope they're of use to you!
